# Getting Started with Create React App

This was a quick website made live during the LA Hacks 2023 React Workshop.

Key points to remember:
main entry points of the program:  index.html -> index.js -> App.js
main file you edit: App.js
Hooks: useState and useEffect
    - duck image has an onClick listener that sets click's state
    - reset button also has an onClick listener that resets clicks
    - useEffect listens to click, sets size's state accordingly
